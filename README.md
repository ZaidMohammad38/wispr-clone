# Wispr Clone (Voice to Text Demo)

This is a basic prototype inspired by Wispr AI.

The application records audio using the browser's MediaRecorder API and simulates a speech-to-text transcription.

> Note: This project does not use real speech-to-text APIs. The transcription is simulated for demonstration purposes.

## Features
- Start / Stop audio recording
- Microphone access using browser APIs
- Simulated transcription output
- Simple and clean UI

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- MediaRecorder API

## How to Run
1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome recommended)
2. Allow microphone permission
3. Click **Start Recording**
4. Speak and click **Stop Recording**
5. View the transcribed output

Note: Due to assignment time constraints and security best
practices, real-time Deepgram integration was not added.

## Future Improvements
- Integrate real Speech-to-Text API (Whisper, Web Speech API)
- Backend support using Tauri / Node.js
- Audio file upload support
